		On Friday, July 12, when we had already been collected backpacks to go to the festival, there became postapat 
		fragmentary information that the event was banned and kicked out of the woods.</p>	

		<p>At the last moment it was found out that the organizers and the local authorities have different understandings 
concept of reconciliation. Ultimately, the event still banned. 
No festival and there was no music. Any initiatives thwarted by police.
</p>
			<p>Organizers promised to return the money for the tickets.

		<p>I was very impressed with the Reanimatolog's gear: lightweight tent, usb adapter and network 220 Laptop 
charging from solar panels, compact and efficient gas burner with pans.</p>
