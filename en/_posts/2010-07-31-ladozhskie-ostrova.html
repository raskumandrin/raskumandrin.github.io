		<p>Train to Kuznechnoe (I never thought that the train can be <i>so</i> full of people), 
	from the station for a hundred rubles a taxi to the boat station, 
	driveway to one side of a boat to some island costs 500 rubles.</p>

		In general, topographic maps take on <a href="http://poehali.org/maps">poehali.org</a>.</p>

		<p>At the boatyard can rent a boat with oars. But you need to come on Thursday - Friday evening had nothing to rent taking. 
On a boat driven without lifejackets (well. .. so we drove), red entries to the driver does not wear seat (if facemask, 
that if he fell off the boat, pull the wiring and the engine stalls; Well, the boat will not float away). 
Ie transport safety in general no.</p>

		<br>

		<p>On the islands as usual - stones, moss, pine - beautiful.</p>

		<p>Parking cooked: hearth, built of stones, spears for bowlers, places for tents, convenient approaches to water.</p>

		<p>Samovar stoked for days. Very handy thing in the campaign. Moving of the samovar is uncomfortable.</p>

		<p>Boat station called "Silver". Phone +7-921-598-15-89, Valery (well, at least it is not safe, but we need to all 
still somehow move to these islands; it's worth it, yes; probably).</p>


		<h2 class="gray">Comment (June 13, 2011)</h2>
		<p class="gray">Just returned from another trip. 
Add about phones taxi from the boat station to the Forge: 
"Blacksmithing Taxi Express" +7-981-809-00-60, 
+7-931-304-10-66, +7-962-682-83-71. 
Cheap (relatively bombed that Kuznechny) and drove two cars at the same time, 
since we are not all one climbed. And there's some expensive phone (but do not say that quality) taxi: 
+7-903-096-87-03.</p>
